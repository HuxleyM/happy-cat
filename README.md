# HappyCat

HappyCat is a service that will send users a number of animal GIF's per day.

# Design

This is an app to use to sign up to the HappyCat service, built using React.js and tested using Jest and Enzyme.

# wireframes

# challenges

I have not used React for over a year and a half. I had to quickly relearn the basics as well as trying to move to the new React standards and they're appropriate testing.

Functional react components are awesome, however a little tough to start testing as I had problems stubbing methods within the function.

State management was tricky, i looked into redux before discovering the useContext and useState hooks in React.

# future of the project

I'd like this project to send out a confirmational email as well as to send out the actual gif emails.

I'd like to implement end to end testing with cypress but had time restraints and was unable to complete this.

Finish setting up eslint.
